# gravity-visual
simulation of gravity for great visual

# keys feature
   * 3 color setting
  * a lot of parameter to play with
  * possiblility to create custom ring system
  
  # setting explain
  ## star setting
  
  * x , y , z coordonate -define the position of the star
  * mass    -define the mass of the star
  * size  - define the size of the star
  
  ## general setting
  
  * grid    -if checked will show a grid
  * pxmode  -if checked activate the pxmode
  * trace   -if checked the planet will leave a trace behind them 
  * collision   -if checked will activate the collision mode inn this mode if a planet touch the star the star absorb the planet and get bigger
  * g value   -change the value of gravity force
  * time value -change the time interval high value will run faster but will be less precise low value run slower but more precise
  
  ## color setting
  
  * random -each planet will have a random color
  * depend on scalar speed    -each planet will have is color determine by is scalar speed in real time
  * depend on coord speed  -each planet will have is color determine by the speed of each of is coordonate (red=x, blue=y ,z=green)
